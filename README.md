Title: Nookpedia (Animal Crossing Encylopedia)
By: Cynthia Valles

This project is a Full-Stack React Page that provides information regarding in-game items for the video game, Animal Crossing New Horizons. Each page provides each individual donatable item that can be provided to Blathers at the museum. The website also contains a User log-in/Sign-up.
